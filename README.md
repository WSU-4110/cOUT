# CHATBOT


This web application was designed for student to be able to ask questions to their teachers anonmyously. 
Student and teachers are able to create an account on the application. Teachers are able to create a class, while student are able to join a class by the given access code when a teacher creates a class. 
Once a course or class is created, students are able to ask questions to a teacher about the course. The teachers then can either answer the question or delete it. A question is only accessible to other students if the teacher answers the questions. Otherwise, the teacher can either delete the question or refrain from answering, which the question that is not answered will delete within a week. Students also have the ability to nudge their question if it has not been answered, which brings the question to the top of the teacher's list of questions.
